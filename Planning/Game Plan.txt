futuristic zomboid like survival 

post apocalyptic world(war, delusional soldiers, scavenger, bio engineered mutant animals, singularity AI/Killer robots, wild animals/flora, and abandoned building, technology,  vehicles, and ruins) 

world lore
war has happened, everyone unfortunate to still be alive is either fighting to survive, lost their minds, or thriving off the backs of others.

there is many threats within the world such as rogue AIs designed to kill everything or working perfectly from an enemy state even though there is no more war and will use everything at their disposal including bio weapons and killer hunter robots. make sure not to be hunted yourself or get caught in a crossfire.

mutated and wild creatures or savage survivors roam the world looking for their next meal and are more than willing to hunt, swarm and track you down.

coding/Design Notes:
	BreadCrum needs to be 150 > 200 pixels close to each other unless seperated from each other through wall or physical object not two of these can be heading the same direction within this distance.

	Path goto selected node chosen by action which the point that the path the enity is on can find the closest one
	Code the least amount of breadcrums to find disired node.
